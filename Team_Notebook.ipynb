The very first problem i have faced is that how to handle those NaN values in different columns of dataset which varies with device and which kind of proper distribution i should use to cope up with these values so i took a help from stack overflow to find what should be the correct method that maintain my project integrity with a fast execution time as well.\n",

My next aim was to find datatypes of each feature and handle if any irregularity is their by checking their uniqueness and get number of unique elements with their datatypes as well and try to change their datatypes if needed using astypes method. My biggest difficulty was to dealing with `Size` feature as their were so many 'varies with device' values which were not replacable through their mean or median so instead of dropping them i left them as they are because dropping them will affect quality of our analysis.\n",

        "###<b>Shriya Chouhan -</b> My contribution to the project was to anlaysis all the data given to me after cleaning unnecessary stuff. It was a bit challenging to me as data wrangling with visualization of all the data with matplotlib and seaborn libraries was a tough job but I utilised all my skills and with the help of superb content provided by almabetter team I solved the given problem statements.My Biggest challenge was to choose which type of plot should be appropiate for given problem and follow the rules of UBM i.e univariate,bivariate and multivariate analysis so that i can give proper answer for those questions given in template like use of specific chart,its insights and positive & negative growth assumption based on given problem statements.

        "1. Using a bar chart with a logarithmic scale is an effective method for visualizing the percentage of null values in the dataset. This specific chart was chosen because it allows for easy comparison of null percentages across multiple columns in a single chart. This is important because some columns, such as 'Rating' and 'Translated Review' have much higher null percentages than others, which can lead to difficulties in visualizing the data in a traditional bar chart. Without the logarithmic scale, the 'Rating' and 'Translated Review' column would dominate their chart and the bars for the other columns would be too small to read. By using a logarithmic scale, the bars for all columns can be visualized clearly and their relative sizes can be easily compared.\n",

        "**Insights gained from the Chart**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   The column \"Rating\" contains the largest proportion of NaN values, around 13%. Dropping these rows would result in significant data loss, which could potentially reduce the accuracy of the analysis. Instead of dropping the rows, a better approach could be to impute the missing values using an aggregate metric, such as the mean, median or mode of the remaining values in the \"Rating\" column.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.   The other columns (Current Ver, Android Ver, Type, and Content Rating) all have a much lower percentage of null values, with values ranging from 0.0092% to 0.0738%.The low percentage of null values in these columns suggests that the data is generally complete and may be suitable for analysis.\n",
